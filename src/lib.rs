//! Split k-mer analysis (version 2)  uses exact matching of split k-mer sequences to align closely related
//! sequences, typically small haploid genomes such as bacteria and viruses.
//!
//! SKA can only align SNPs further than the k-mer length apart,
//! and does not use a gap penalty approach or give alignment scores.
//! But the advantages are speed and flexibility, particularly the ability to
//! run on a reference-free manner (i.e. including accessory genome variation)
//! on both assemblies and reads.
//!
//! ## Details
//!
//! A split k-mer is a sequence of bases with the middle position removed. For
//! example, the split 9-mer pattern is `XXXX-XXXX`, and the split 9-mers of the
//! sequence `ACGAGAGTCTT` are:
//!
//! | Split k-mer | Middle base |
//! |-------------|-------------|
//! | `ACGAAGTC`  | `G`         |
//! | `CGAGGTCT`  | `A`         |
//! | `GAGATCTT`  | `G`         |
//!
//! Which is broadly how SKA represents sequences in `.skf` files, as a dictionary with split
//! k-mers as keys and the middle base as values. These dictionaries are merged
//! by exactly matching the split k-mers, such that the middle positions are aligned (but
//! unordered). Split k-mers can also be matched to those from a reference sequence
//! to give an ordered pseudoalignment.
//!
//! Various optimisations are used to make this as fast as possible. For a more thorough comparison with version 1.0 of SKA, see the
//! [github description](https://github.com/bacpop/ska.rust/blob/master/README.md).
//!
//! Command line usage follows. For API documentation and usage, see the [end of this section](#api-usage).
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! `.skf` files represent merged split k-mers from multiple sequence files. They
//! are created with `ska build`. You can subsequently use `ska align` to write
//! out an unordered alignment from these files, or `ska map` to write an alignment
//! ordered versus a reference sequence.
//!
//! Alternatively, both `ska align` and `ska map` can take input sequence directly to obtain output alignments
//! in a single command and without saving an `.skf` file. NB: This uses the default options
//! of `ska build`, so to change these you will need to run the alignment in two steps.
//!
//! Output from `ska align` and `ska map` is to STDOUT, so you can use a redirect `>` to save to a file or pipe `|`
//! to stream into another compatible program on STDIN. You can also add an output
//! file prefix directly with `-o` (for `ska build` this is required).
//!
//! ## Common options
//!
//! Version can be viewed by running `ska -V`.
//!
//! Details and progress messages are written on STDERR. You can see more logging
//! information by adding the verbose flag `-v`.
//!
//! ## ska build
//!
//! This command creates an `.skf` file from sequence (.fasta/.fasta.gz/.fastq/.fastq.gz) input.
//! K-mer size must be odd, greater than 5, and a maximum of 63. Smaller k-mers
//! are more sensitive and can find closer positions, but are less specific so
//! may lead to more repeated split k-mers and ambiguous bases. Using k <= 31 uses
//! 64-bit integers and may be faster than 31 < k <= 63, which uses 128-bits.
//!
//! This is typically the most computationally intensive step of `ska`, and
//! multiple `--threads` can be used to split the work over multiple CPU cores.
//!
//! Build from two input FASTA files with a k-mer size of 31:
//! ```bash
//! ska build -o seqs -k 31 assemblies/seq1.fa assemblies/seq2.fa
//! ```
//! This will assume sample names of `seq1` and `seq2` â€“- the base path and with known fastx
//! file extensions removed. If you know the strand,
//! for example when exclusively using reference sequences or single stranded viruses, add `--single-strand`
//! to ignore reverse complements.
//!
//! ### Read files
//!
//! To use FASTQ files, or specify sample names, or more easily input a larger number of input files,
//! you can provide a tab separated file list via `-f` instead of listing files. For example
//! a file called `input_sequence.txt` to describe `sample_1` (an assembly) and `sample_2` (paired reads):
//! ```text
//! sample_1    assemblies/seq1.fa
//! sample_2    reads/seq2_1.fastq.gz   reads/seq2_2.fastq.gz
//! ```
//! You'd run:
//! ```bash
//! ska build -o seqs -f input_sequence.txt
//! ```
//! Options for filtering/error correction are:
//! - `--min-count`. Specify a minimum number of appearances a k-mer must have
//! to be included. This is an effective way of filtering sequencing errors if set
//! to at least three, but higher may be appropriate for higher coverage data.
//! A two-step blocked bloom and countmin filter is used for memory efficiency.
//! - `--qual-filter`. `none` do not filter based on quality scores.
//! `middle` (default) filter k-mers where the middle base is below the minimum quality.
//! `strict` filter k-mers where any base is below the minimum quality.
//! - `--min-qual`. Specify a minimum PHRED score to use in the filter.
//!
//! FASTQ files must be paired end. If you'd like to request more flexibility in
//! this regard please contact us.
//!
//! ### Threads
//!
//! The maximum threads actually used will be a power of two, so if you provided
//! `--threads 6` only four would be used. Additionally, at least ten samples per
//! thread are required so maximums are:
//!
//! | Samples | Maximum threads |
//! |---------|-----------------|
//! | 1-19    | 1               |
//! | 20-39   | 2               |
//! | 40-79   | 4               |
//!
//! and so on. Use `-v` to see a message with the number being used.
//!
//! Using more threads will increase memory use.
//!
//! You can also run blocks of samples independently (e.g. with snakemake or a
//! job array) then use `ska merge` to combine results.
//!
//! ## ska align
//!
//! Creates an alignment from a `.skf` file or sequence files. Sites (columns) are
//! in an arbitrary order. Two basic filters are available: `--min-freq` which
//! sets the maximum number of missing sites; `--filter` which can be set to
//! one of three options:
//! * `no-filter` -- no extra filtering
//! * `no-const` -- no constant sites
//! * `no-ambig-or-const` -- no constant sites, or sites where the only variable base is ambiguous
//!
//! `no-filter` may be useful for ascertainment bias correction in phylogenetic algorithms,
//! but note the flanking split k-mers will never be included. `no-const` is the default.
//! `no-ambig-or-const` can be used when you want to treat any ambiguity as an `N`.
//!
//! With an `.skf` file from `ska build`, constant sites, and no missing variants:
//! ```bash
//! ska align --min-freq 1 --filter no-filter -o seqs seqs.skf
//! ```
//!
//! Another example: directly from FASTA files, with default `build` and `align` settings,
//! and gzipping the output alignment
//! ```bash
//! ska align seq*.fa --threads 8 | gzip -c - > seqs.aln.gz
//! ```
//!
//! ## ska map
//!
//! Create an alignment from a `.skf` file or sequence files by mapping its
//! split k-mers to split k-mers of a linear reference sequence. This produces pseudoalignment
//! with the same sites/columns as the reference sequence. Sites not mapped will
//! be output as missing '-'.
//!
//! Pass the FASTA file of the reference as the first argument, and the skf file as
//! the second argument:
//! ```bash
//! ska map ref.fa seqs.skf -o ref_mapped.aln
//! ```
//! Add `--repeat-mask` to mask any repeated split k-mers in the reference with 'N'.
//!
//! You can also get a VCF as output, which has rows as variants, and only has the
//! variable sites (but will include unmapped bases as missing).
//! An example command, also demonstrating that everything can be done from input sequences in a single command:
//! ```bash
//! ska map ref.fa seq1.fa seq2.fa -f vcf --threads 2 | bgzip -c - > seqs.vcf.gz
//! ```
//!
//! ## ska distance
//!
//! Use to calculate distances between all samples within an `.skf` file. The output
//! will contain the number of SNP differences between all pairs of samples, as
//! well as the proportion of matching k-mers.
//!
//! ```bash
//! ska distance -o distances.txt seqs.skf
//! ```
//!
//! Ignore ambiguous bases by adding `--filter-ambiguous` flag, and `--min-freq` to
//! ignore k-mers only found in some samples. Multiple threads
//! can be used, but this will only be effective with large numbers of samples.
//!
//! The companion script in `scripts/cluster_dists.py` (requires `networkx`) can
//! be used to make single linkage clusters from these distances at given thresholds,
//! and create a visualisation in [Microreact](https://microreact.org/):
//! ```bash
//! ska distance seqs.skf > distances.txt
//! python scripts/cluster_dists.py distances.txt --snps 20 --mismatches 0.05
//! ```
//! If you install `rapidnj` and `biopython` you can also draw an NJ tree from
//! these distances, which will be displayed in Microreact. Use your `--api-key`
//! to directly upload and get the URL printed on the terminal.
//!
//! ## ska merge
//!
//! Use to combine multiple `.skf` files into one, typically for subsequent use in `align` or `map`.
//! This may be particularly useful if `ska build` was run on multiple input files
//! one at a time (for example in a job array).
//!
//! ```bash
//! ska merge -o all_samples sample1.skf sample2.skf sample3.skf
//! ```
//!
//! ## ska delete
//!
//! Remove samples by name from an `.skf` file. All sample names must exist in the
//! file, or an error will be thrown. After removing samples, the input `.skf` file will be overwritten.
//! Any split k-mers which have no observed missing bases after removal will also be deleted.
//!
//! ```bash
//! ska delete all_samples.skf sample_1 sample_3
//! ```
//! If you wish to delete many samples, you can use `-f` to provide their names
//! by line via an input file.
//!
//! ## ska weed
//!
//! Remove (weed) split k-mers from an `.skf` file. The split k-mers to be removed
//! are generated from a FASTA file, which may for example contain known transposons or
//! other repeat sequences. As with `delete`, the input `.skf` file is overwritten.
//!
//! ```bash
//! ska weed all_samples.skf MGEs.fa
//! ```
//!
//! In addition, you can also use `ska weed` to filter split k-mers by proportion of samples
//! they appear in, and constant or amibguous middle cases, which does
//! not require a list of split k-mers to be removed (but both can be used together, if you wish).
//!
//! For example, you may want to reduce the size of an `.skf` file for online use.
//! You can do this by removing any constant sites or ambiguous-only s0tes (which are typically unused), and by hard-filtering
//! by frequency (i.e. before writing output):
//! ```bash
//! ska weed --filter no-ambig-or-const --min-freq 0.9 all_samples.skf
//! ```
//!
//! ## ska nk
//! Return information on the *n*umber of *k*-mers in an `.skf` file. This will
//! print on STDOUT:
//! - The version of ska used to build the file.
//! - The k-mer size.
//! - Number of bits used for the split k-mer (64 or 128).
//! - Whether reverse complements were used.
//! - The total number of split k-mers.
//! - The total number of samples.
//! - The sample names.
//! - The number of split k-mers found in each sample.
//!
//! ```bash
//! ska nk all_samples.skf
//! ska_version=0.3.1
//! k=21
//! k_bits=64
//! rc=true
//! k-mers=3228084
//! samples=28
//! sample_names=["19183_4#73", "12673_8#29", "12673_8#31", "12754_5#61", "12754_5#89", "12754_5#47", "12754_5#32", "12754_5#78", "12754_4#85", "12754_5#74", "19183_4#57", "12754_5#36", "19183_4#49", "19183_4#79", "19183_4#60", "12754_5#24", "12754_5#22", "12754_5#71", "12673_8#26", "12754_5#95", "12754_5#86", "12673_8#24", "19183_4#61", "12673_8#41", "12754_4#66", "12754_5#80", "12754_5#84", "19183_4#78"]
//! sample_kmers=[2872587, 2997448, 2949719, 2997496, 2997178, 2912749, 2996491, 2997221, 2949102, 2997454, 2914109, 2912237, 2872518, 2869957, 2872470, 2997992, 2997647, 2958512, 2998099, 2997290, 2950253, 3027707, 2997881, 2907920, 2911447, 2997644, 2944830, 2915080]
//! ```
//!
//! If you add `--full-info`, the split k-mer dictionary will be decoded and printed
//! to STDOUT after the baseline information, for example:
//! ```bash
//! TAAATATC        TAAACGCC        A,-
//! AGACTCTC        TACAGCTA        G,G
//! AAACCATC        AAACACTC        A,-
//! TTAAAAGA        TCTCGTAC        C,C
//! ```
//! This is tab-separated, showing the first and second half of the split k-mer
//! and the middle bases of each sample (comma seperated).
//!
//! NB: Only one split k-mer is shown even if the reverse complement was used.
//! These are not precisely canonical k-mers, as the encoding order `{A, C, T, G}` is used internally.
//! But if you can't find a sequence in your input file, you will find its reverse complement.
//!
//! ## ska cov
//!
//! Estimate a coverage cutoff for use with read data. This will count the split
//! k-mers in a pair of FASTQ samples, and create a histogram of these counts.
//! A mixture model is then fitted to this histogram using maximum likelihood,
//! which can give a suggested cutoff with noisy data.
//!
//! The cutoff will be printed to STDERR. Use `-v` to get additional information on the
//! optimisation progress and result. A table of counts and the fit will be printed
//! to STDOUT, which can then be plotted by the companion script in
//! `scripts/plot_cov.py` (requires `matplotlib`):
//! ```bash
//! ska cov reads_1.fastq.gz reads_2.fastq.gz -k 31 -v > cov_plot.txt
//! python scripts/plot_cov.py cov_plot.txt
//! ```
//!
//! The cutoff can be used with the `--min-count` parameter of `ska build`. For
//! a set of sequence experiments with similar characteristics it may be sufficient
//! to use the same cutoff. Alternatively `ska cov` can be run on every sample
//! independently (`gnu parallel` would be an efficient way to do this).
//!
//! # API usage

//! let k = 17;
//! let quality = QualOpts {min_count: 1, min_qual: 0, qual_filter: QualFilter::NoFilter};
//! let threads = 2;
//! // NB u64 for k<=31, u128 for k<=63

//! ska_array
//!     .save(format!("merged.skf").as_str())
//!     .expect("Failed to save output file");
//! ```
//!
//! To use `ska align` in other rust code:
//! ```rust
//! use ska::io_utils::{load_array, set_ostream};
//! use ska::cli::FilterType;
//!
//! // Load an .skf file
//! let threads = 4;
//! let input = vec!["tests/test_files_in/merge.skf".to_string()];
//! let mut ska_array = load_array::<u64>(&input, threads).expect("Could not open input as u64");
//!
//! // Apply filters
//! let min_count = 2;
//! let update_kmers = false;
//! let filter = FilterType::NoConst;
//! ska_array.filter(min_count, &filter, update_kmers);
//!
//! // Write out to stdout
//! let mut out_stream = set_ostream(&None);
//! ska_array
//!     .write_fasta(&mut out_stream)
//!     .expect("Couldn't write output fasta");
//! ```
//!
//! To use `ska map` in other rust code, see the example for [`ska_ref`].
//!
//! ## Other APIs
//!
//! It would be possible to make a python API using [`maturin`](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin).
